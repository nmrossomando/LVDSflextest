# LVDSflextest
Test design for OSH Park's new flex PCB service.
And also a test design for some LVDS stuff.

I have designed for neither before. I'm sure it'll be fine.

For the flex pcb test, I was asked to:
- Have thin traces (check, 6 mil except for 3V3 and GND)
- Fill (check, ground planes on both layers)
- Tent vias (check)
- I quote, "Stitch the crap out of it" (check, double check, triple check)
